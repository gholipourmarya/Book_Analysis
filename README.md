# Book Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary
The **Book Analysis** is a Python-based project designed to read and analyze multiple book text files. It extracts metadata like title and author, and provides interactive statistics such as word count, line count, spaces, and frequency of specific words. This can be used for text analysis and data extraction from large collections of books.

---

## 2. Objective and Scope

### Objective:
- To develop a program that reads, extracts metadata, and analyzes multiple books’ contents.

### Scope:
- Reading text files from a `books/` folder  
- Extracting titles, authors, and translators  
- Counting words, lines, spaces, and specific word occurrences  
- Interactive command-line interface for user selections

---

## 3. Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.12
- **Libraries:**
  - `os` for file system operations  
  - `colorama` for colored terminal output

---

## 4. Execution Files

- `main.py` — Entry point of the application  
- `load_file.py` — Module to load books and extract metadata  
- `Analyesewunsch.py` — Contains the `Count` class for analyzing book contents

---

## 5. User Guide:

1. Place your book `.txt` files inside the `books/` folder.  
2. Run the program by executing:


3. Follow the interactive menu to:
- Analyze a specific book  
- Analyze all books together  
- Analyze each book individually  
4. Input the word you want to count within the texts.

## 6. Implemented Features

- Automatic extraction of book titles and authors (or translators)  
- Counting of words, lines, spaces in each book  
- Case-insensitive search for specific words  
- Interactive text-based user interface for selecting analysis modes

---

## 7. Future Enhancements

- Support for different file formats (e.g., PDF, EPUB)  
- GUI interface for easier interaction  
- More detailed statistical reports (e.g., frequency distributions)  
- Exporting analysis results to CSV or JSON

## Notes

> This tool is intended for educational purposes and basic text analysis of book collections. For larger datasets or more complex formats, additional development is recommended.
